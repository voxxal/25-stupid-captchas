=x= AIDEN SHI'S INCREDIBLE WALKTHROUGH TO 25 STUPID CAPTCHAS =x=

this game is pretty stupid, so here is a little guide to help 
you if you get stuck.

for any "select all with" puzzles, selected tiles will be
denoted with a "#"

# Level 1
no tricks played here, the following are the 2 possible 
solutions.
oo## | oo##
oo## | o###
oo## | oo##
oo## | oo##

# Level 2

don't select any tiles. this is a reference to Rene Magritte's
painting "The Treachery of Images" [1]. the text reads "this is
not a pipe" because it is not, but rather an image.

# Level 3
the answer is D

# Level 4
drag the wire from the left to the right of the same color.

# Level 5
select at least 3 squares then press the button.
the button is pressable, keep trying!

# Level 6
the captcha actually says "I am a robot." drag the word not from
the text between the word "am" and "a." then press the button

# Level 7
the maze is unsolvable. instead draw the red line around the
maze.

# Level 8
drag the patty to the stoves, wait for it to change color once.
follow the following rules when putting together the burger.
- start with the bottom bun and end with the top bun
- use at least 1 cooked patty in the burger
- do not put cheese under the patty (unless you are stacking
  patties)
- don't repeat one ingredient twice in a row

# Level 9

long answer:

oo3o
2o1o

there are 3 mines in the following tiles
o1 1
3o 
oo3 
2 1 

there is only one tile in the following tiles
o1 1
3o 
  3 
2 1 

thus these 2 tiles must have mines
 1 1
3  
##3 
2 1 

because of these mines the other 3 must have 2 more mines here
 1 1
3ooo
##3 
2 1 

the only valid configuration of two mines is the following
 1 1
3# #
##3 
2 1 

# Level 10

referring to the ship of theseus [3], which asks the question
if every part of a boat is replaced, is it still the same boat?

both answers are accepted, if you think there its a different
boat, just skip, otherwise if you think the boat is the same,
select the boat.

# Level 13
